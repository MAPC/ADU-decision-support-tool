# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool evaluates what parcels in a municipality are likely eligible to pursue the development of ADU under a given ADU policy, and what of those parcels are large enough to accommodate the smallest allowable ADU. In this way, the Analytical Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a way to understand&#x20;

The Analytical Tool uses publicly-available data to evaluate up to four different ADU Typologies:

* Type 1 ADUs:
* Type 2 ADUs:
* Type 3 ADUs:
* Type 4 ADUS:

The Tool generates a table&#x20;
