# 2Aii. How much space is required around the ADU?

### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Outstanding Questions (Copied to</mark> [<mark style="background-color:orange;">Proposed Next Steps</mark>](../proposed-next-steps.md)<mark style="background-color:orange;">)</mark>

* [ ] Will the ordinance define minimum space around the ADU? If so, what dimensional regulations will be used? A partial list is below, under Factors We Could Explore.

### Factors We Could Explore

* ADU Front Setback, Side Setbacks, and Rear Setback
* Separation between ADU and Principal Building
  * For reference, policy options from Ella on minimum buffers:&#x20;
    * No change:  N/A
    * Potential changes:&#x20;
      * Same as underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
      * Half of underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
      * 10 feet&#x20;
* Separation between ADU and other Accessory Buildings
  * Is it safe to assume a maximum of one ADU per lot? (This is consistent with the existing ordinance.) If not, will you define a minimum separation between ADUs? How?
* Orientation of entrance, one other statement about entrances I don't understand
  * For reference, policy options from Ella the design requirements for ADUs?&#x20;
    * No change: Entrance must be enclosed and into side or rear&#x20;
    * Potential change: Same design requirement as primary dwelling&#x20;
