# 4. How many ADUs will be developed?

### Yield Over Time

> As of 2018, 37 out of the 100 municipalities in the MAPC region allowed ADUs for non-family members. However, the number of permitted ADUs remains low. Based on the report, 2.5 units are permitted annually in each municipality on average, with the most being 15 per year. The 20 municipalities without requirements that occupants be family members averaged 1.8 permits for every 1,000 houses over a period of three years. (From Ella's summary of _The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units_, Dain, 2018).
