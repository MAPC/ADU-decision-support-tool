# 5. What are the impacts of that development?

### From Scope

> MAPC will also develop methods for estimating the effects of ADU construction on key metrics such as homeowner financial benefits, tax revenue, housing diversity,  and other key outcomes identified in previous phases of the project. These draft methods will identify the data inputs necessary to estimate policy effects, including data inputs that may not yet be readily available.&#x20;

### Possible Factors to Explore

#### Concerns from Ella's Summary of The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units (Dain, 2018)

> According to the report, residents often have several concerns about increasing density in existing residential areas, including traffic, aesthetics, protection of green space, and preservation of the value of most peopleâ€™s largest asset: their house. ADUs provide an option for increasing housing choices that addresses some of the main concerns. Specifically, the landlord of most ADUs live on-site, thus they are interested in the upkeep and potential impacts of the ADU residents. Secondly, ADUs are often designed to appear as a single-family home, whether attached or detached.

Ella's ADU Policy Options document had the following list:

#### Primary Impacts&#x20;

* \# of additional bedrooms (and # occupants, from The State of Zoning)
* \# of Affordable units&#x20;
* \# of total units&#x20;
* Estimated locations of new units&#x20;

#### Related Impacts&#x20;

* Demographic impacts&#x20;
* School system&#x20;
* Financial (Personal and Municipal)&#x20;
* Environmental Impacts&#x20;
* Congestion and Parking&#x20;

Other factors have not yet been translated from the Airtable or Powerpoint.
