# Parameters Table

The **Parameters** table contains records for 120 factors, or parameters, that could support our calculations of parcel eligibility, ADU feasibility, and ADU yield. The parameters in the table are organized by how they might contribute to our analysis (for example, parameters that might help us understand how much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors). Consistent with the scope's summary of Task 3.1, some parameters fall within multiple contribution categories.

The parameters below were derived from a list [Ella developed earlier on in the project](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BeverlyADU/EdrFA5ToqJFErbr3pPZ3UyABw02Hyxaegec8JVK8d\_XOtQ?e=Sa5Z7o), which was supplemented with additional parameters identified by Data Services when developing the analysis plan. While we anticipate some overlap, it has not been updated since Ella's development of the three documents provided for the ADU Policy Options Matrix. It seems like Ella also added additional parameters to her document after I translated it to Airtable, so additional review might be beneficial.

A table like this is not strictly necessary for analysis, though we imagine it being useful moving forward.
