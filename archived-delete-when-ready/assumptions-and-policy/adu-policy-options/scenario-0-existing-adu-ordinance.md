Article IX Special Density and Dimensional Regulations Section 300-55 Accessory apartments1 regulates the development of Accessory apartments, also known as ADUs. The ordinance explicitly states that the ordinance is not intended to encourage the construction of large homes that ADUs. Instead, it is intended to enable homeowners of existing homes to create an ADU, to create housing alternatives for elderly people, and to “encourage a diverse population with a particular focus on senior citizens and young adults.”&#x20;

Under the ordinance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a special permit for an existing home in any residential zoning district to include an ADU, according to the following requirements: &#x20;

#### Dimensions/design&#x20;

* One ADU per lot&#x20;
* Maximum size of ADU: 900 gross square feet or 30% of gross floor area of the primary home&#x20;

* Maximum of two bedrooms per ADU&#x20;
* 1 parking space per ADU in the Depot Overlay District, 2 parking spaces per ADU everywhere else&#x20;
* ADU must be self-contained\[2], share a common vertical or horizontal wall with the primary home (therefore within or attached to primary home), and be accessible from the primary home through a doorway on the common wall&#x20;
* One front entrance per primary home; new external entrance for ADU must be on side or rear of building. All stairways leading to upper stories must be internal. &#x20;

#### Process/permitting&#x20;

* Special permit for the ADU terminates upon the death of the designated occupant, change of residence of the designated occupant, or transfer of ownership&#x20;
* Following termination, kitchen must be removed from the ADU within 90 days and house reverts to single-family home&#x20;
* Zoning Board may impose additional requirements, including off-street parking, no change to building façade along public way, or other conditions “to avoid detriment to the neighborhood or to nearby persons or property”&#x20;

#### Limits on potential residents&#x20;

* ADU occupant must be a relative of the primary home occupants &#x20;
