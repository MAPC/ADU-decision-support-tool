For any newly established use; or any change from one use to another; or for any use increased in intensity or physically enlarged by more than 25% under this chapter, off-street parking and loading space shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule in this section. Off-street parking and/or loading requirements for uses other than those cited in this article shall be determined in consultation with the applicant by the Building Inspector on recommendation from the Planning Board. The Building Inspector, on recommendation from the Planning Board, may require additional spaces if the particular use so warrants.

#### **Residential Uses**

* In all zoning districts, parking spaces for residential uses must be provided:
  * On site; or
  * Off site on a privately owned lot located within 500 feet of the property/use(s) it is designed to serve; or
  * By special permit, off-site parking in a public parking facility within 500 feet of the property/use it is designed to serve.
* Five hundred feet shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the subject property to the nearest point of the off-site parking facility.

### Table of Off-Street Parking Requirements

The **Parking Requirements** table contains a partial list of minimum off-street parking, by bedroom count, for Beverly base and overlay zones. As with the Dimensional Requirements table, the requirements do not reflect any additional requirements in the text of the zoning ordinance. The [Parking Requirements GitBook page](./) does contain some excerpts of the zoning and some information about parking estimation methods used by Data Services in past analyses.

We will need a table like this for any variable dimensional requirements the analysis takes into account.&#x20;

### Lot, Vehicle, and Location Restrictions

* No accessory off-street parking space shall be permitted within the required front yard in any R District, except that this shall not be construed as applying to parking required for a one- or two-family dwelling.
* "Piggy-back" parking, in which each space does not have independent access to a driveway or street, is not allowed, except when such spaces are permanently assigned to the same residential unit and except for one- and two-family homes.

### Design Requirements

* Standard parking spaces. Each parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and 18 feet in length. Aisle width shall be a minimum of 18 feet for one-way traffic and 24 feet for two-way traffic.
* No portion of any entrance or exit driveway shall be closer than 20 feet to the curb of an intersecting street.
