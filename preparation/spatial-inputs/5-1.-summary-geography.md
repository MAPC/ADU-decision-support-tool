# 5-1. Summary Geography

The **Summary Geography** input is optional. It is used in the final model tool, 5 | Summary of Results, to generate a table with rows with the geographic features (i.e., neighborhoods, school districts, sewered and unsewered areas) and columns with counts of eligible parcels. This offers one way to understand the possible results of ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the desired summary geography.&#x20;
* [ ] Review the summary geography attribute table, creating the following fields if they do not exist:
  * Geography ID (geo\_id): Abbreviated name of the geography. This field should not contain any spaces.&#x20;
  * Geography Name (geo\_name): Name of the geography, as the user would like it to appear in the table. This field may contain spaces.
* [ ] Export the resulting file to  ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "summary\_geo."&#x20;
