# 5-1. Summary Geography

The **Summary Geography** input is optional. It is used in the final model tool, 5 | Summary of Results, to generate a table with rows listing the geographic features (i.e., neighborhoods, school districts, sewered and unsewered areas) and columns with corresponding counts of eligible parcels. This offers one way to understand the possible results of ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the desired summary geography.&#x20;
* [ ] If working with multiple data layers, merge them into a single layer. **Eliminate any overlapping features. The final layer must contain a field "geo\_id" (Data Type: Text, Suggested Alias: Geography ID), populated with the abbreviated name of the geography, and a field "geo\_name" (Data Type: Text, Suggested Alias: Geography Name), populated with the name of the geography, as the user would it to appear in the summary table.**
* [ ] Export the resulting file to  ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "summarygeo."&#x20;
