# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool evaluates what parcels in a municipality are likely eligible to pursue the development of ADU under a user-defined ADU policy. In the case of new construction ADUs (ADUs built either as an addition to an existing building or as a new accessory structure), the ADU Analytical Tool also evaluates what of those eligible parcels are also large enough to physically accommodate the smallest allowable ADU. In these ways, the ADU Analytical Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of eligible parcels under different ADU policies.

The Analytical Tool uses publicly-available data to evaluate up to four different ADU Typologies:

* Type 1 ADUs (Principal-Existing) are ADUs that are developed within the principal building on the parcel, without any expansion of that building's foundation. ADUs in this category could be created through the conversion of an existing floor or floors or through the development of new floors, provided the principal building is not at or above the maximum allowable building height. &#x20;
* Type 2 ADUs (Principal-New) ADUs are ADUs that are developed adjacent to the principal building, through an addition.
* Type 3 ADUs:
* Type 4 ADUS:
