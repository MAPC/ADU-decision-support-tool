# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet the spatial criteria set forth in an ADU policy, and are thus likely eligible for ADU development. In the case of new construction ADUs (that is, ADUs that are built as an addition to an existing structure or built as a new accessory structure), the ADU Analytical Tool also evaluates which eligible parcels are also sufficiently large to physically accommodate an ADU. In these ways, the ADU Analytical Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels likely eligible for ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

The ADU Analytical Tool evaluates eligibility for up to four different ADU typologies:

* **Principal-Existing ADUs** (Type 1 ADUs), which are ADUs developed within the principal building, without any expansion of that building's foundation. ADUs in this category would be created through the conversion of an existing space, such as an attic.&#x20;
* **Principal-New ADUs** (Type 2 ADUs), which are ADUs developed as an addition to the principal building, through an expansion of that building's foundation.
* **Accessory-Existing ADUs** (Type 3 ADUs), which are ADUs developed within an existing accessory structure, without any expansion of that building's foundation.&#x20;
* **Accessory-New ADUs** (Type 4 ADUs), which are ADUs developed as a new, accessory structure, one that is detached from all other structures on the parcel.

The ADU Analytical Tool generates a table with fields corresponding to each of these four ADU typologies, and rows for each of the parcels in the municipality. A value of "1" is assigned in an ADU Type column (1, 2, 3, or 4) when that parcel is likely eligible for that type of ADU; a value of "0" indicates that parcel is likely ineligible for that type of ADU.&#x20;

### Guidebook&#x20;

This Guidebook provides a general overview of the ADU Analytical Tool and instructions for its operation: software and downloads, tabular and spatial inputs, and tool components. The Guidebook provides a level of instruction that should be suitable for an intermediate GIS user, who has access to the relevant software.

Questions about the ADU Analytical Tool may be directed to the Data Services department at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, using the email address datarequests@mapc.org.
