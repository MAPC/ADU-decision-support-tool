# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality are likely eligible to pursue the development of ADU under an existing or proposed ADU policy. In the case of new construction ADUs (ADUs built either as an addition to an existing building or as a new accessory structure), the ADU Analytical Tool also evaluates which of those parcels eligible to pursue ADU development are also large enough to physically accommodate the smallest allowable ADU. In these ways, the ADU Analytical Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels eligible to pursue ADU development under different ADU policies.

The ADU Analytical Tool evaluates up to four different ADU Typologies:

* Type 1 ADUs (Principal-Existing) are ADUs that are developed within the principal building on the parcel, without any expansion of that building's foundation. ADUs in this category could be created through the conversion of an existing floor or floors.&#x20;
* Type 2 ADUs (Principal-New) ADUs are ADUs that are developed adjacent to the principal building, through an addition.
* Type 3 ADUs: XXX
* Type 4 ADUS: XXX

The ADU Analytical Tool generates a table with rows for each of the parcels in the municipality, and fields corresponding to the four types of ADUs.
