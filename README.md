# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet criteria set forth in an ADU policy and are thus likely to be eligible for ADU development. In the case of new construction ADUs (that is, ADUs that are built as a new addition to an existing structure or as a new accessory structure), the tool also evaluates which eligible parcels are large enough to physically accommodate an ADU.&#x20;

In these ways, the ADU Tool equips municipal staff, their partners, and the communities they serve with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels likely eligible for ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

The ADU Tool evaluates parcel eligibility for up to four different ADU typologies:

* **Principal-Existing ADUs** (Type 1 ADUs) - ADUs developed within the principal building, without any expansion of that building's foundation. ADUs in this category would be created through the conversion of an existing space, such as an attic.&#x20;
* **Principal-New ADUs** (Type 2 ADUs) - ADUs developed as an addition to the principal building, through an expansion of that building's foundation.
* **Accessory-Existing ADUs** (Type 3 ADUs) - ADUs developed within an existing accessory structure, without any expansion of that building's foundation.&#x20;
* **Accessory-New ADUs** (Type 4 ADUs) - ADUs developed as a new, accessory structure, one that is detached from all other structures on the parcel.

The ADU Tool outputs a table with fields corresponding to each of these four ADU typologies and rows for all of the parcels in the municipality. A value of "1" is assigned in an ADU Type column (1, 2, 3, or 4) when that parcel is likely eligible for that type of ADU; a value of "0" indicates that the parcel is likely ineligible for that type of ADU.&#x20;

### Guidebook&#x20;

This guidebook provides a general overview of the ADU Tool and its operation: software and downloads, tabular and spatial inputs, and tool components and their instructions. The guidebook provides a level of explanation that should be suitable for an intermediate GIS user with access to the relevant software.

Questions and feedback about the ADU Tool may be directed to the Data Services department at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), using the email address datarequests@mapc.org.

### Acknowledgments

The development of the ADU Tool was funded by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) through a Planning Assistance Grant. The tool was created to support the City of Beverly and MAPC in their work updating the City's existing ADU ordinance; we are grateful to the City for providing vital feedback throughout our development process.
