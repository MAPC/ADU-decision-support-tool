# ADU Analytical Tool

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet the criteria set forth in a given ADU policy, and are thus likely eligible to pursue the development of ADU. In the case of new construction ADUs (that is, ADUs that are built as an addition to an existing structure or as a new accessory structure), the ADU Analytical Tool also evaluates which of those eligible parcels are also large enough to physically accommodate an ADU. In these ways, the ADU Analytical Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels eligible to pursue ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

The ADU Analytical Tool evaluates eligibility for up to four different ADU typologies:

* Principal-Existing ADUs (Type 1 ADUs), which are ADUs developed within the principal building and without any expansion of that building's foundation. ADUs in this category would be created through the conversion of an existing space, like an attic.&#x20;
* Principal-New ADUs (Type 2 ADUs), which are ADUs developed adjacent to the principal building, through an addition.
* Accessory-Existing ADUs (Type 3 ADUs), which are ADUs developed within an existing accessory structure and without any expansion of that building's foundation.&#x20;
* Accessory-New ADUS (Type 4 ADUs), which are ADUs developed as a new accessory structure, separate from all other structures on the parcel.

The ADU Analytical Tool generates a table with rows for each of the parcels in the municipality, and fields corresponding to each of these four ADU typologies. A value of "1" indicates a parcel is likely eligible for that type of ADU; a value of "0" indicates a parcel is likely ineligible for that type of ADU.&#x20;

#### Guidebook&#x20;

The Guidebook provides a general overview of the tool and instructions to download and operate tool. The Guidebook is developed for an intermediate GIS user, equipped with the relevant software.
