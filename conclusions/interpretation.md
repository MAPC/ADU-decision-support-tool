# Interpretation

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet criteria set forth in an ADU policy and are thus likely to be eligible for ADU development. In this way, the ADU Tool equips municipal staff, their partners, and the communities they serve with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels likely eligible for ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

In interpreting the results of the tool, we would highlight two key points:&#x20;

* The results of the tool are estimates, subject to the quality of the input data and the key assumptions enumerated in the [Analysis](broken-reference) sections.
* The results of the tool provide a likely maximum of ADUs that could be constructed under a given ADU policy. This maximum is likely to be less than the number of property owners that pursue ADU permitting (where relevant) and ADU construction. See the [note below](interpretation.md#adu-adoption-rates) on ADU Adoption Rates for more detail.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Planners working on the Beverly ADU Ordinance Update found it helpful to discuss the results of the tool with the public in percentage terms, for example, "X% of residential parcels are eligible for ADU development. If all of these property owners pursue ADU development, the number of housing units would increase by Y%; if 1 out of every 100 eligible property owners pursues ADU development, the number of housing units would increase by Z%." This framing contextualizes the results, which generally yields more productive conversations. Planners also found visual aids, such as pie charts, to be helpful in communicating their findings.</mark>

#### ADU Adoption Rates

As part of our development of the ADU Tool, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) explored ADU adoption rates, as in, the number of owners of parcels eligible for an ADU who pursue ADU development. One resource we turned to was, "[The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units](https://ma-smartgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ADU-MSGA-Pioneer-paper-2018.pdf)," which was written by Amy Dain in 2018. This paper discusses ADU zoning policies in the 101 cities and towns in the MAPC region and includes a section with counts of ADU permits in 2015, 2016, and 2017. These permitting numbers are very helpful and will likely be useful to cities and towns seeking to understand what might follow the adoption of an ADU Bylaw or Ordinance. These permitting numbers are not tied to the specific ADU policy, however, which means they cannot be used to generate an adoption rate that could be applied to other places.&#x20;

In light of this, MAPC instead looked to Portland, OR, and Seattle, WA, two cities with longstanding ADU policies. We were not able to find an adoption rate for Portland but Seattle generously shared a set of spatial data with ADU criteria that could be read into our ADU Tool. Using their published construction numbers and our approximation of their eligible parcels, MAPC determined that in the three years following the City's ADU Ordinance Update, approximately 1% of eligible Seattle property owners constructed an ADU. While this rate provides helpful context when interpreting the result of the ADU Tool, it should not be interpreted as a guarantee of the number of ADUs, particularly the maximum number of ADUs. Simply, there are many factors not present in the ADU Tool that influence adoption, including local context, permitting processes, and the availability of financing. <mark style="background-color:green;">Not many financial tools are available for ADU Development at this time, which is a major limitation, as a conversion of an existing space or structure to an ADU costs approximately $100,000 and the construction of a new, detached ADU costs approximately $200,000.</mark>
