# Interpretation

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet criteria set forth in an ADU policy and are thus likely to be eligible for ADU development. In this way, the ADU Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels likely eligible for ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

In interpreting the results of the tool, we would highlight two key points:&#x20;

* The results of the tool are estimates, subject to the quality of the input data and the key assumptions enumerated in the [Analysis](broken-reference) sections.
* The results of the tool provide a likely maximum of ADUs that could be constructed under a given ADU policy. This maximum is likely to be less than the number of property owners that pursue ADU permitting (where relevant) and ADU construction. See the [note below](interpretation.md#adu-adoption-rates) on ADU Adoption Rates for more detail.

Planners working on the Beverly ADU Ordinance Update found it helpful to discuss the results of the tool in percentage terms, for example, <mark style="background-color:orange;">\[CLARIFICATION FROM JOHN.]</mark>

#### ADU Adoption Rates

As part of our development of the ADU Tool, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) explored ADU adoption rates, as in, the number of owners of parcels eligible for an ADU who pursue ADU development. One valuable resource on ADUs in greater Boston is, "[The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units](https://ma-smartgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ADU-MSGA-Pioneer-paper-2018.pdf)," written by Amy Dain in 2018. This paper discusses ADU zoning policies in the 101 cities and towns in the MAPC region and includes a section with counts of ADU permits in 2015, 2016, and 2017. While these permitting numbers are incredibly helpful, they are not tied to the specific ADU policy and therefore fall short of enabling the creation of a rate.&#x20;

In light of this, MAPC instead looked to Portland, OR, and Seattle, WA, two cities with longstanding ADU policies. We were not able to find an adoption rate for Portland but Seattle generously shared a set of spatial data with ADU criteria that could be read into our ADU Tool. Using their published construction numbers and our approximation of their eligible parcels, MAPC determined that in the three years following the City's ADU Ordinance Update, approximately 1% of eligible Seattle property owners constructed an ADU. This rate provides helpful context when interpreting the result of the ADU Tool, however, it should not be interpreted as a "guarantee" for the number of ADUs. There are many factors not present in the ADU Tool that influence adoption: permitting processes, financing, and more.
