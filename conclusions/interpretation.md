# Interpretation

The Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Analytical Tool identifies which parcels in a municipality meet criteria set forth in an ADU policy, and are thus likely to be eligible for ADU development. In this way, the ADU Tool equips municipal staff and their partners with a means to evaluate the quantity and distribution of parcels likely eligible for ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.

In interpreting the results of the tool, we would highlight two key points:&#x20;

* The results of the tool are estimates, subject to the quality of the input data and the key assumptions enumerated in the [Analysis](broken-reference) sections.
* The results of the tool provide the maximum ADUs that could be constructed under a given ADU policy. This maximum is likely to be less than the number of property owners that pursue ADU permitting (where relevant) and ADU construction. See the [note below](interpretation.md#adu-adoption-rates) for more details.

Planners working on the Beverly ADU Ordinance Update found it helpful to discuss the results of the tool in percentage terms, for example, <mark style="background-color:orange;">\[CLARIFICATION FROM JOHN.]</mark>
