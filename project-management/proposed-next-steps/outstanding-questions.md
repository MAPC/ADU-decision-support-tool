## Needed from Land Use

### ASAP

#### Project Management

* [ ] Clarity design of decision-support tool
* [ ] Clarity on Task 3 Deliverables "template engagement materials"
* [ ] Do we need to document the Road Map in a bigger way? Can it be retroactive?
* [ ] Organizational structure for communication on policy options
* [ ] Organizational structure for numerical inputs

#### Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?

* [ ] Are there ADU typologies we're exploring that you don't see as being necessary? Are there additional ADU typologies you would like us to explore? We're planning to explore [the four described here](../../analysis/part-a-feasibility/1.-available-space/).
  * From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What types of ADUs are allowed?&#x20;
    * No change: Attached&#x20;
    * Potential changes: &#x20;
      * Attached and existing detached&#x20;
      * Attached, existing detached, and new detached&#x20;
* [ ] Is it safe to assume a maximum of one ADU per lot? (This is consistent with the existing ordinance.)
* [ ] **Accessory-New:** How much space should exist between the principal building and a detached ADU? Will this buffer be a fixed or a flexible parameter?
  * From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What types of ADUs are allowed? If detached is allowed, what is the minimum buffer between ADU and primary?&#x20;
    * No change:  N/A
    * Potential changes:&#x20;
      * Same as underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
      * Half of underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
      * 10 feet&#x20;
* [ ] **Principal-New and Accessory-New:** Will detached ADUs be allowed in parcel setbacks?
* [ ] **Principal-New and Accessory-New:** Please confirm the setback amounts in the Minimum Yards - Front, Minimum Yards - Side, and Minimum Yards - Rear [columns in the Airtable.](../../policy/assumptions-and-policy/citywide-dimensional-requirements.md) Will these setbacks be fixed or flexible parameters?
  * [ ] Also to resolve:
    * What are the minimum setbacks?&#x20;
    * No change: Same as underlying lot size&#x20;
    * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * Rear, side, and/or front setbacks are decreased to x, x, and x feet&#x20;
    * No additional setback for ADUs within or attached to non-conforming existing structures&#x20;
  * [ ] Need clarity on:
    *
    [ ]   * What is the yard requirement?&#x20;
      * No change: None&#x20;
      * Potential changes:&#x20;
      * If detached is allowed, minimum of x square feet of yard is required
      * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Also: Is there a setback that will just apply to ADUs? Or in area of the parcel where ADUs may only be constructed?**</mark>&#x20;

#### Part A | 1Bii. How much of the allowable density is already consumed?

* [ ] We assume ADUs will contribute to some parcel-wide dimensional regulations. For example, if a parcel is built out to the maximum allowable FAR, an ADU cannot be built. Is this assumption correct? If so, what of the existing dimensional regulations should we take into account? [A partial list is here.](../../analysis/part-a-feasibility/1bii.-how-much-of-the-allowable-density-is-already-consumed.md)
* [ ] Options:
  * What is the maximum lot coverage?&#x20;
  * No change: None&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
  * X% for lots greater than Y square feet and Z% for lots less than Y square feet&#x20;
*
[ ]   * What is the limit on density?&#x20;
  * No change: Based on lot size, frontage, and setbacks&#x20;
  * Potential change: Maximum of d/u per acre&#x20;

#### Part 2Ai. How much space is required for the ADU structure?

* [ ] How small of an ADU is too small? How large of an ADU is too large? What dimensional regulations will be used to define this? [A partial list is here.](outstanding-questions.md#part-2ai.-how-much-space-is-required-for-the-adu-structure)
*
[ ]   * What is the maximum ADU footprint?&#x20;
  * No change: 900 square feet or 30% of gross floor area of primary home&#x20;
  * Potential changes&#x20;
  * Increase in maximum square feet&#x20;
  * Increase in maximum percentage of primary home&#x20;

#### Part B | 3A. Is an ADU allowable given the individual characteristics of the parcel?

* [ ] Should the analysis exclude parcels where dimensional requirements have been exceeded and where the parcel is likely non-confirming? If so, what dimensional requirements should we take into account?
* [ ] From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What are the minimum frontage requirements?&#x20;
  * No change: Same as underlying frontage requirements&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * If detached is allowed, frontage requirements are increased to x, x, and x feet&#x20;
* [ ] From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What is the minimum lot size for an ADU?&#x20;
  * No change: Same as underlying lot size&#x20;
  * Potential changes: &#x20;
  * ADU would not contribute to unit count for variable minimum lot size, for example in R-6&#x20;
  * If detached is allowed, increase minimum lot size to x square feet or by x%&#x20;

#### Confirm List of Things we are Backburner-ing

How will minimum lot area factor into the analysis? Should we consider the ability to sub-divide a lot?

### As soon as possible

* [ ] List of factors to explore (don't need specific thresholds, just an indication that they will be important.)

### Soon

* [ ] Confirmation of method for siting Principal-Existing and Accessory-Existing ADU typologies

#### Part B | Eligibility

### Later

## Next Steps for Data Services

#### Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?

* [ ] Review proposed method for Principal-Existing and Accessory-Existing ADU typologies; identify an option or options to propose to Land Use.

#### Part A | 1Bi. How much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors?

* [ ] Review possible environmental factors
* [ ] Discuss ignoring this part of the analysis&#x20;



## Parameters

* Are all land uses (residential and non-residential) in Beverly eligible?
* Are all residential units (1 unit, 2 units, 3 units) in Beverly eligible?
* Requirement versus value: i.e. Land area un-developable due to flood zone
* What if you can subdivide the parcel into two?
* Multiple ADUs
*

    we'll want to place on the analysis. We will also need to understand how certain dimensional requirements will interact with ADUs. For example:

    * Can ADUs be constructed in the Front, Side, or Rear Yard setbacks?
    * Will an ADU contribute to the parcel-wide FAR requirement?
    * The table does not include restrictions for overlay zones.



Confirm ADU Typologies (PPT suggests six types; this might not be needed for our project.)

1. Detached, new construction
2. Detached, conversion of an existing structure
3. Attached, new addition on the principal building
4. Attached, conversion of a space in the principal building (upper level, lower level, attached garage conversion)

## Assumptions

* Minimum width for an ADU?
* Minimum parking space size?
* Not considering adding floors.
