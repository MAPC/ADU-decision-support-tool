# Data Services Subtasks

A copy of the original scope is [saved here](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/sites/BeverlyADU/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x01200026A59B5019BBDC40B1B76EA92F79F918\&siteid=%7B0972F1FF%2D). Any emphasis and formatting of the subtasks below is mine. Our progress on each of these subtasks is rendered in the [Status by Subtask](<../../README (1).md>) section.

### Task 3. Develop Decision Support Tool

<details>

<summary>Subtask 3.1 Development Roadmap</summary>

Working from the Policy Options Matrix developed in Task 1, MAPC will develop <mark style="background-color:green;">**draft methods for quantifying the effect of various options on eligibility, yield, and feasibility at the parcel level.**</mark>&#x20;

* For example, eligibility can be conditioned based on lot area or building square footage, proximity to transit, wastewater disposal, presence in a historic district, age of home, existing lot coverage, or other parcel attributes available from assessor data and other sources.&#x20;
  * Where the impact of a specific policy requirement cannot be determined based on available data, MAPC will use proxy data to estimate the effects.&#x20;
  * Yield and adoption estimates will be based on MAPC’s research and may be presented as ranges rather than point estimates.&#x20;
* MAPC will also develop methods for estimating the effects of ADU construction on key metrics such as homeowner financial benefits, tax revenue, housing diversity,  and other key outcomes identified in previous phases of the project. These draft methods will identify the data inputs necessary to estimate policy effects, including data inputs that may not yet be readily available.&#x20;
* MAPC will also map out the interactions and dependencies between various policy options. Working with City staff and drawing from the input provided by regional stakeholders, <mark style="background-color:green;">**MAPC will develop a prioritized list of policy options and indicators to encode and a strategy for addressing interactions and dependencies.**</mark> &#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:green;">**The product of this task will be a software development roadmap.**</mark>

<summary>Subtask 3.2 Decision Support Tool Development – Phase 1</summary>

Using the software development roadmap, MAPC staff will conduct three development ‘sprints’ designed to create a draft product for City review. &#x20;

* The first sprint will focus on **assembling the data necessary for the high priority policy options** to be tested and high priority metrics to be created.&#x20;
* The second sprint will focus on creating a **beta version of the decision support tool to test out the highest priority options and create core metrics.** The beta version will be reviewed internally.&#x20;
* The third development sprint will focus on **additional feature development with the goal of producing a version of the tool ready for City staff review.**&#x20;

While the specific technology “stack” to be used is still TBD, it is likely that the development will use Esri ArcMap or ArcPro and Python.  <mark style="background-color:green;">**All development will be documented and version-controlled using GitHub so that the project will eventually be able to accept contributions from other users and software developers.**</mark> &#x20;

<details>

<summary>Subtask 3.3 Decision Support Tool Development – Phase 2</summary>

MAPC will demo the tool for City staff and will organize a webinar for regional stakeholders who were involved in Task 1. The demo will seek to elicit feedback on the quality and utility of the estimates and indicators, as well as their presentation. The results of this demo will be used to revise the software development roadmap as necessary, and MAPC will conduct one additional development sprint to incorporate high priority features and changes.

<details>

<summary>Subtask 3.4 Decision Support Tool User Interface and Engagement Products</summary>

MAPC staff will develop a user interface and guidebook for the decision support tool. The Data Services, Land Use, and Community Engagement teams will also collaborate on the design of both in-person and virtual engagement activities that use the tool to structure a stakeholder conversation about policy options and outcomes. The product will be a decision support tool suitable for use by technical staff with skills in the requisite software, guidance on its use, and template materials for public engagement.

#### Task 3 Deliverables

Fully-documented decision support tool codebase; user guide; template engagement materials

### Task 4. ADU Scenarios

<details>

<summary>Subtask 4.1  Develop ADU Scenarios</summary>

Working with the City and Advisory Committee, <mark style="background-color:green;">**MAPC will design at least three potential ADU policy alternatives**</mark> demonstrating a spectrum of ADU ordinance options. Each of the ordinance alternatives will have different iterations of <mark style="background-color:green;">**dimensional regulations, parking standards, applicability, permitting, and other parameters. The decision support tool will be used to model the projected yield and local impacts of the scenarios.**</mark>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Subtask 4.2 Digital outreach on ADU Scenarios</summary>

MAPC will present the ADU ordinance scenarios through <mark style="background-color:green;">**a multimedia/multi-channel online campaign accompanied by rich visuals and concise explanations.**</mark> The goals of the campaign will be to familiarize community members with the various options, solicit their feedback on those options, and identify supportive residents who may be enlisted in advocacy on behalf of the ordinance.
