# Proposed Next Steps

Data Services next step on Subtask 3.2 is to devise a method to internally buffer a parcel's front, side, and rear lot lines by their respective setbacks to determine the subarea of the parcel which could theoretically be used for further development.&#x20;

After this point, we will need input from the project team on the following higher-priority questions:&#x20;

### ASAP

<details>

<summary>Project Management</summary>

* [ ] Confirmation that the roadmap can stay as-is (see notes under [Subtask 3.1](status-by-subtask/subtask-3.1.md))
* [ ] Clarity on the "template engagement materials" task 3 deliverable (see [Data Services Subtasks](reference/data-services-subtasks/))
* [ ] Collaborate to define the design of the decision-support tool (see notes under [Decision Support Tool](../analysis/decision-support-tool.md))
* [ ] Collaborate to define an organizational structure for communication on policy options
* [ ] Collaborate to define an organizational structure for numerical inputs

</details>

<details>

<summary>Analysis</summary>

* [ ] We're planning to explore [the four ADU typologies described here](../analysis/part-a-feasibility/1.-available-space/). Are there typologies we're exploring that you don't see as being necessary? Conversely, are there ADU typologies not under consideration that you would like us to explore?&#x20;
* [ ] <mark style="background-color:orange;">Draft list of parameters to explore so that we can assemble all needed data layers. (We don't need specific thresholds at this time, just an indication that they will be important.)</mark>

</details>

### Sooner

<details>

<summary>Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?</summary>

* [ ] **For Principal-Existing and Principal New:**&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Part A | 1Bi. How much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors?</summary>

No questions for Land Use at this time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Part A | 1Bii. How much of the allowable density is already consumed?</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Part A | 2Ai. How much space is required for the ADU structure?</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Part A | 2Aii. How much space is available around the ADU? </summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Part A | 2B. How much space is required for the parking associated with the ADU?</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Part B | 3A. Is an ADU allowable given the individual characteristics of the parcel?</summary>



</details>

### Later

* [ ] Confirmation of method for siting Principal-Existing and Accessory-Existing ADU typologies



## Next Steps for Data Services

#### General

* [ ] What types of analysis will we deprioritize?

#### Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?

* [ ] Review proposed method for Principal-Existing, Accessory-Existing, and Principal-New ADU typologies; identify an option or options to propose to Land Use.
* [ ] Devise a method to internally buffer a parcel's front, side, and rear lot lines by their respective setbacks to determine the subarea of the parcel which could theoretically be used for further development.&#x20;

#### Part A | 1Bi. How much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors?

* [ ] Review possible environmental factors, particularly if we want to ignore this part of the analysis&#x20;
