# Proposed Next Steps

Data Services next step on Subtask 3.2 is to devise a method to internally buffer a parcel's front, side, and rear lot lines by their respective setbacks to determine the subarea of the parcel which could theoretically be used for further development.&#x20;

After this point, we will need input from the project team on the following higher-priority questions:&#x20;

### ASAP

#### Project Management

* [ ] Confirmation that the roadmap can stay as-is (see notes under [Subtask 3.1](status-by-subtask/subtask-3.1.md))
* [ ] Clarity on the "template engagement materials" task 3 deliverable (see [Data Services Subtasks](reference/data-services-subtasks/))
* [ ] Collaborate to define the design of the decision-support tool (see notes under [Decision Support Tool](../analysis/decision-support-tool.md))
* [ ] Collaborate to define an organizational structure for communication on policy options
* [ ] Collaborate to define an organizational structure for numerical inputs

#### **General**

* [ ] We're planning to explore [the four ADU typologies described here](../analysis/part-a-feasibility/1.-available-space/). Are there typologies we're exploring that you don't see as being necessary? Conversely, are there ADU typologies not under consideration that you would like us to explore?&#x20;
* [ ] <mark style="background-color:orange;">Draft list of parameters to explore so that we can assemble all needed data layers. (We don't need specific thresholds at this time, just an indication that they will be important.)</mark>

### Soon

#### For Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?

* [ ] **For Principal-Existing and Principal New:** _The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units_ (Dain, 2018) suggests ADU Ordinances and Bylaws commonly control ADUs by **percent of primary unit floor area** and/or **percent expansion of primary dwelling.** Do you imagine wanting to regulate ADUs using either or both of these parameters?
* [ ] **For Principal-New and Accessory-New:** Will detached ADUs be allowed in parcel setbacks? Will this be a fixed or flexible parameter?
* [ ] **For Principal-New and Accessory-New:** Please confirm that the setbacks recorded in the Minimum Yards - Front, Minimum Yards - Side, and Minimum Yards - Rear [columns in the Airtable](../policy/assumptions-and-policy/citywide-dimensional-requirements.md) are correct. Will these setbacks be fixed or flexible parameters? For reference, options from Ella on minimum setbacks:
  * No change: Same as underlying lot size&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * Rear, side, and/or front setbacks are decreased to x, x, and x feet&#x20;
    * No additional setback for ADUs within or attached to non-conforming existing structures&#x20;
* [ ] **For Accessory-New:** What is the minimum buffer between the principal building and a detached ADU? Will this buffer be a fixed or a flexible parameter? For reference, options from Ella on minimum buffers:&#x20;
  * No change:  N/A
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * Same as underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
    * Half of underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
    * 10 feet&#x20;
* [ ] **For Accessory-New:** Is there a front yard setback that will only apply to ADUs? (Put differently, will there be an area of the parcel where ADUs may only be constructed?) This might relate to these options from Ella on yard requirements:
  * No change: None&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * If detached is allowed, minimum of x square feet of yard is required

#### Part A | 1Bii. How much of the allowable density is already consumed?

* [ ] We assume ADUs will count towards at least a few parcel-wide density controls. For example, if an ADU would push the parcel beyond a maximum FAR, the ADU could not be built. Is this assumption correct? If so, what of the existing (or non-existing) dimensional regulations should we take into account? [A partial list is here.](../analysis/part-a-feasibility/1bii.-how-much-of-the-allowable-density-is-already-consumed.md)
  * For reference, options from Ella on maximum lot coverage:
    * No change: None&#x20;
    * Potential changes:&#x20;
      * X% for lots greater than Y square feet and Z% for lots less than Y square feet&#x20;
  * For reference, options from Ella on density:
    * No change: Based on lot size, frontage, and setbacks&#x20;
    * Potential change:&#x20;
      * Maximum of d/u per acre&#x20;
* [ ] Is it safe to assume we can ignore the potential for subdivision of lots greater than twice the lot area minimum?

#### Part 2Ai. How much space is required for the ADU structure?

* [ ] How small of an ADU is too small? How large of an ADU is too large? What dimensional regulations will be used to define this? [A partial list is here.](proposed-next-steps.md#part-2ai.-how-much-space-is-required-for-the-adu-structure) For reference, options from Ella on maximum ADU footprint:
  * No change: 900 square feet or 30% of gross floor area of primary home&#x20;
  * Potential changes:
    * Increase in maximum square feet&#x20;
    * Increase in maximum percentage of primary home&#x20;
* [ ] What should we use as a minimum dimension for an ADU? (This is needed as an assumption in our analysis, but may not be translated to policy.)
* [ ] Is it safe to assume a maximum of one ADU per lot? (This is consistent with the existing ordinance.) If not, will you define a minimum separation between ADUs? How?

#### Part B | 3A. Is an ADU allowable given the individual characteristics of the parcel?

* [ ] Should the analysis exclude parcels where dimensional requirements have been exceeded and where the parcel is likely non-confirming? If so, what dimensional requirements should we take into account?
* [ ] From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What are the minimum frontage requirements?&#x20;
  * No change: Same as underlying frontage requirements&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * If detached is allowed, frontage requirements are increased to x, x, and x feet&#x20;
* [ ] From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What is the minimum lot size for an ADU?&#x20;
  * No change: Same as underlying lot size&#x20;
  * Potential changes: &#x20;
    * ADU would not contribute to unit count for variable minimum lot size, for example in R-6&#x20;
    * If detached is allowed, increase minimum lot size to x square feet or by x%&#x20;

### Later

* [ ] Confirmation of method for siting Principal-Existing and Accessory-Existing ADU typologies
*

## Next Steps for Data Services

#### General

* [ ] What types of analysis will we deprioritize?

#### Part A | 1A. How much space exists on this parcel?

* [ ] Review proposed method for Principal-Existing, Accessory-Existing, and Principal-New ADU typologies; identify an option or options to propose to Land Use.
* [ ] Devise a method to internally buffer a parcel's front, side, and rear lot lines by their respective setbacks to determine the subarea of the parcel which could theoretically be used for further development.&#x20;

#### Part A | 1Bi. How much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors?

* [ ] Review possible environmental factors, particularly if we want to ignore this part of the analysis&#x20;
