# Subtask 3.2

<details>

<summary>For reference, subtask description (from Data Services Subtasks)</summary>

Using the software development roadmap, MAPC staff will conduct three development ‘sprints’ designed to create a draft product for City review. &#x20;

* The first sprint will focus on **assembling the data necessary for the high priority policy options** to be tested and high priority metrics to be created.&#x20;
* The second sprint will focus on creating a **beta version of the decision support tool to test out the highest priority options and create core metrics.** The beta version will be reviewed internally.&#x20;
* The third development sprint will focus on **additional feature development with the goal of producing a version of the tool ready for City staff review.**&#x20;

While the specific technology “stack” to be used is still TBD, it is likely that the development will use Esri ArcMap or ArcPro and Python.  <mark style="background-color:green;">**All development will be documented and version-controlled using GitHub so that the project will eventually be able to accept contributions from other users and software developers.**</mark> &#x20;

## Work Completed to Date

### Ongoing: Development Sprint 1&#x20;

> The first sprint will focus on assembling the data necessary for the high priority policy options to be tested and high priority metrics to be created.

In addition to the [Parameters table](../../policy/parameters/parameters-table.md) that supports the flowchart described in the [Subtask 3.1](subtask-3.1.md) status update, the Beverly ADU Airtable base houses three other tables that will aid in our development of the decision support tool. The information in these tables also appears in the [Supporting Information](broken-reference) section of this GitBook, where it has been embedded and then supplemented with non-tabular data. Please refer to the [Parcel Data](../../policy/parcel-characteristics/) page, the [Citywide Dimensional Requirements](../../policy/assumptions-and-policy/citywide-dimensional-requirements.md) page, and the [Parking Requirements](../../policy/assumptions-and-policy/parking-requirements/) page for more details.

Outside of the Airtable base and this GitBook, Data Services has created a geodatabase for the project and started to analyze parcel geometry, specifically identifying the front, side, and rear lot lines of each parcel, separating those lines into individual segments, and measuring them. This  that . which will be needed to evaluate whether a parcel can accommodate an external ADU.

### Next: Development Sprint 2&#x20;

> The second sprint will focus on creating a beta version of the decision support tool to test out the highest priority options and create core metrics. The beta version will be reviewed internally.

### After: Development Sprint 3

> The third development sprint will focus on additional feature development with the goal of producing a version of the tool ready for City staff review.
