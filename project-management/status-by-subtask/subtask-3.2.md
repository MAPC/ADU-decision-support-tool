# Subtask 3.2

<details>

<summary>For reference, subtask description (from Data Services Subtasks)</summary>

Using the software development roadmap, MAPC staff will conduct three development ‘sprints’ designed to create a draft product for City review. &#x20;

* The first sprint will focus on **assembling the data necessary for the high priority policy options** to be tested and high priority metrics to be created.&#x20;
* The second sprint will focus on creating a **beta version of the decision support tool to test out the highest priority options and create core metrics.** The beta version will be reviewed internally.&#x20;
* The third development sprint will focus on **additional feature development with the goal of producing a version of the tool ready for City staff review.**&#x20;

While the specific technology “stack” to be used is still TBD, it is likely that the development will use Esri ArcMap or ArcPro and Python.  <mark style="background-color:green;">**All development will be documented and version-controlled using GitHub so that the project will eventually be able to accept contributions from other users and software developers.**</mark> &#x20;
