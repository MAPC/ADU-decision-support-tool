# Subtask 3.1

<details>

<summary>For reference, subtask description (from Data Services Subtasks)</summary>

Working from the Policy Options Matrix developed in Task 1, MAPC will develop <mark style="background-color:green;">**draft methods for quantifying the effect of various options on eligibility, yield, and feasibility at the parcel level.**</mark>&#x20;

* For example, eligibility can be conditioned based on lot area or building square footage, proximity to transit, wastewater disposal, presence in a historic district, age of home, existing lot coverage, or other parcel attributes available from assessor data and other sources. **Where the impact of a specific policy requirement cannot be determined based on available data, MAPC will use proxy data to estimate the effects.**&#x20;
* Yield and adoption estimates will be based on MAPC’s research and may be presented as ranges rather than point estimates.&#x20;
* MAPC will also develop methods for estimating the effects of ADU construction on key metrics such as homeowner financial benefits, tax revenue, housing diversity,  and other key outcomes identified in previous phases of the project. These draft methods will identify the data inputs necessary to estimate policy effects, including data inputs that may not yet be readily available.&#x20;
* MAPC will also map out the interactions and dependencies between various policy options. Working with City staff and drawing from the input provided by regional stakeholders, **MAPC will develop a prioritized list of policy options and indicators to encode and a strategy for addressing interactions and dependencies.** &#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:green;">**The product of this task will be a software development roadmap.**</mark>

## Work Completed to Date

In the project scope, the Development Roadmap is informed by the ADU Policy Options Matrix. No single ADU Policy Options Matrix emerged during Task 2.3 (see below, Task 2.3 ADU Policy Options Matrix), however, Data Services has charted a general plan for our analysis using the documents Ella provided.&#x20;

<summary>Task 2.3 ADU Policy Options Matrix</summary>

Summarized ADU zoning best practices from The State of Zoning for Accessory Units by Amy Dain and the MA Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Model ADU Bylaw: [Background on ADUs in Beverly report](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/BeverlyADU/EU\_ZwwLqSyZHtzJuzYbo9\_ABc9h\_WoQbSk\_Ih1fgBYb8Jg?e=fCTK8g) (saved on the K drive as “Background on ADUs in Beverly” in the Policy review & draft ordinance folder)

* Notes from Lily
  * Contains a summary of Beverly's current ADU Policy (dimensions/design, process/permitting, and limits on potential residents)&#x20;
  * Contains a summary of parameters often used in ADU Zoning Codes (from Dain, the State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units)
  * Contains model ADU Bylaw from EEA

Outlined the key policy decisions and main options for each: [ADU Policy Options](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/BeverlyADU/Ea-uHaA-JplNtHzHRWPhtycB01Y23W36jPBLV2kcRQ573g?e=4IgGnm) (saved on the K drive as “ADU Policy Options” in the Policy review & draft ordinance folder).&#x20;

This general plan exists in two formats: a flowchart developed in an Airtable base by linking parameters and a PowerPoint presentation developed for the City and Steering Committee. The Airtable flowchart (developed April 2021) is more detailed and is ordered according to how Data Services would proceed with the analysis, while [the PowerPoint](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/BeverlyADU/EcBUewI8TBRFgeZjJBx8z6gBmtuYnLU6rRtfUkSxwNO8XQ?e=17rrD2) presentation (developed in June 2021) is less detailed and is ordered according to how the City and MAPC might consider policy decisions. <mark style="background-color:orange;">**Importantly, neither option adequately considers ADU typologies beyond a new, detached structure, and resolution of additional typologies must be a priority in the next phase of work.**</mark>

While many more decisions need to be made, I believe the existing development roadmaps fulfill the scope, and I think we should turn our attention to the remaining tasks.
