<summary>The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units, Amy Dain</summary>

[https://ma-smartgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ADU-MSGA-Pioneer-paper-2018.pdf](https://ma-smartgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ADU-MSGA-Pioneer-paper-2018.pdf)&#x20;

Amy Dain’s report is the go-to resource on municipal ADU regulations in the Boston metropolitan area. Written in 2018, it is based on comprehensive research of municipal regulation and summarizes the overly restrictive requirements commonly found in zoning codes, especially within the context of a regional housing crisis and changing demographics. &#x20;

According to the report, residents often have several concerns about increasing density in existing residential areas, including traffic, aesthetics, protection of green space, and preservation of the value of most people’s largest asset: their house. ADUs provide an option for increasing housing choices that addresses some of the main concerns. Specifically, the landlord of most ADUs live on-site, thus they are interested in the upkeep and potential impacts of the ADU residents. Secondly, ADUs are often designed to appear as a single-family home, whether attached or detached. The report explains: “Most houses within walking distance of stores and public transportation are on smaller lots; it’s good for both the region’s traffic levels — and its people — to have more residents in walkable neighborhoods where cars aren’t needed for every activity. Cautious voters seeking to protect the character of their single-family neighborhoods should be reassured that they risk virtually nothing by allowing ADUs to provide much-needed housing, and they could potentially gain rental income.”&#x20;

Municipalities have been increasingly interested in ADU reform, adding related strategies to Master Plans and Housing Production Plans. Given the benefits of ADUs to help address the housing crisis, many municipalities have recently updated their ADU bylaws/ordinances. As of 2018, 37 out of the 100 municipalities in the MAPC region allowed ADUs for non-family members. However, the number of permitted ADUs remains low. Based on the report, 2.5 units are permitted annually in each municipality on average, with the most being 15 per year. The 20 municipalities without requirements that occupants be family members averaged 1.8 permits for every 1,000 houses over a period of three years. &#x20;

The report finds that ADU zoning codes often include the following parameters:&#x20;

* Owner occupancy&#x20;
* Overall cap on ADU production&#x20;
* Restrictions on primary dwellings&#x20;
  * Age of the house&#x20;
  * Minimum floor area&#x20;
  * Lot size&#x20;
* Restrictions on ADUs&#x20;
  * Parking&#x20;
  * Number of bedrooms&#x20;
  * Number of occupants&#x20;
  * Maximum floor area&#x20;
  * Percent of primary unit floor area&#x20;
  * Percent expansion of primary dwelling&#x20;
* Detached or attached&#x20;
* By Right or Special Permit&#x20;
* Occupancy restricted to relatives&#x20;
* Short-term rentals&#x20;

<summary>Model ADU Bylaw, MA Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs </summary>

[https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/11/03/Accessory%20Dwelling%20Units%20%28ADU%29.pdf](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/11/03/Accessory%20Dwelling%20Units%20\(ADU\).pdf)&#x20;

The MA Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs provides an annotated model ADU bylaw as part of the Smart Growth/Smart Energy toolkit. The model bylaw provides tested and streamlined language for a potential zoning amendment. In particular, comments explain certain provisions of the bylaw, and there are recommended positions on the key policy decisions, as follows&#x20;

* Do not restrict tenants to family members, low- or moderate-income tenants&#x20;
* Allow ADUs within a home by right, and require a Special Permit for attached and detached ADUs&#x20;
* Require 1 parking space per unit and consider a waiver when transit is accessible&#x20;
* Do not require annual compliance or renewal&#x20;
