# Citywide Dimensional Requirements

The **Dimensional Requirements** table contains dimensional requirements for Beverly's base and overlay zones, including Minimum Lot Area, Maximum Lot Coverage, and Minimum Frontage. These requirements are sourced from Beverly's Table of Dimensional Requirements and do not reflect any additional dimensional requirements in the text of the zoning ordinance.&#x20;

We will need a table like this for any variable dimensional requirements the analysis takes into account.&#x20;
