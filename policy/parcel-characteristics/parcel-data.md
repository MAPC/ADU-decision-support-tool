# Parcel Data

The **Field Inventory** table contains records for the 113 parcel attributes available in the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database and the Beverly CAMA database. Of these 113 fields, we believe 41 might be relevant to our analysis. We've included fields description their potential utility in the analysis.&#x20;

A table like this is not strictly necessary for analysis, though we imagine it being useful moving forward.
