# Parameters Table

The **Parameters table** contains factors (largely spatial parameters) organized by how they might contribute to our analysis (for example, parameters that might help us understand how much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors). Consistent with the scope's summary of Task 3.1, some parameters fall within multiple contribution categories.

A table like this is not strictly necessary for analysis, though we imagine it being useful moving forward.
