# Parameters Table

The parameters in the table are categorized by how they might contribute to the analysis (for example, parameters that might help us understand how much space is undevelopable due to environmental factors); consistent with the summary of 3.1 in the scope, some parameters fall within multiple contribution categories.

A table like this is not strictly necessary for analysis, though we imagine it being useful moving forward.
