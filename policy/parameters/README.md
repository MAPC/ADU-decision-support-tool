# Parameters

The **Parameters** table (embedded [here](parameters-table.md)) contains records for 120 factors, or parameters, that could support our calculations of parcel eligibility, ADU feasibility, and ADU yield. The parameters in the Airtable were derived from a list [Ella developed earlier on in the project](https://mapc365.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BeverlyADU/EdrFA5ToqJFErbr3pPZ3UyABw02Hyxaegec8JVK8d\_XOtQ?e=Sa5Z7o), which was supplemented with additional parameters identified by Data Services when developing the analysis plan. While we anticipate some overlap, it has not been updated since Ella's development of the three documents provided for the ADU Policy Options Matrix. It seems like Ella also added additional parameters to her document after I translated it to Airtable, so additional review might be beneficial.
