# Deliverable 2: User Guide

From Scope:

MAPC staff will develop a user interface and guidebook for the decision support tool. The Data Services, Land Use, and Community Engagement teams will also collaborate on the design of both in-person and virtual engagement activities that use the tool to structure a stakeholder conversation about policy options and outcomes. The product will be a decision support tool suitable for use by technical staff with skills in the requisite software, guidance on its use, and template materials for public engagement.
