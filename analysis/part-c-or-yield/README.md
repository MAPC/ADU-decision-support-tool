# Part C | Yield

### From Scope

> * Where the impact of a specific policy requirement cannot be determined based on available data, MAPC will use proxy data to estimate the effects.&#x20;
> * Yield and adoption estimates will be based on MAPC’s research and may be presented as ranges rather than point estimates.
