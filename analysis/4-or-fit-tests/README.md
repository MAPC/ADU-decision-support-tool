# 4 | Fit Tests

The fourth part of the analysis consists of four models, one for each ADU typology. These models each result in a feature class ("parcels\_passforadu\[#]") with geometry and attributes of the parcels that have passed through that fit test and are likely eligible for that typology. **At this time, a user must run all four fit tests, even if that ADU type is not permitted in the municipality, as model 5 | Summary of Results requires all four inputs to run.**
