# 2B. How much space is required for the parking associated with the ADU?

Minimum parking space size?

We will need to assess parking requirements for all ADU typologies.&#x20;

### Factors From Ella's ADU Policy Options

How many parking spaces are required per ADU?&#x20;

* No change: 1 parking space per ADU in the Depot Overlay District, 2 parking spaces per ADU everywhere else
* Potential changes: &#x20;
  * None in some areas&#x20;
  * 1 in all areas&#x20;
  * Allow on-street parking in lieu of off-street parking&#x20;
  * 1 in some areas, 2 in other areas&#x20;

For reference, EEA's model bylaw suggests requiring 1 parking space per unit and considering a waiver when transit is accessible.

### Possible Approaches

Option 1: There is no field in the parcel data that reflects the number of on-site parking spaces, however, we could approximate this by dividing `sqm_pave` by an estimate of parking space size. If we're doing this, we should also evaluate parking spaces in each garage (Attached, Detached, Basement.)&#x20;

Option 2 (Recommended): Assume that every parcel will need additional parking spaces for the ADU.
