# 2Ai. How much space is required for the ADU structure?

### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Outstanding Questions (Copied to</mark> [<mark style="background-color:orange;">Proposed Next Steps</mark>](../../project-management/proposed-next-steps.md)<mark style="background-color:orange;">)</mark>

* [ ] Will the ordinance define ADU size? If so, what dimensional regulations will be used? A partial list is below, under Factors We Could Explore.
* [ ] What should we use as a minimum dimension for an ADU? (This is needed as an assumption in our analysis regardless of whether it is translated to policy.)

### Factors We Could Explore

* ADU Model (see 1A)
* ADU Minimum Floor Area
  * Current Ordinance: meet requirements of Stateâ€™s sanitary code&#x20;
* ADU Maximum Floor Area
  * Current Ordinance: Maximum size of ADU: 900 gross square feet or 30% of gross floor area of the primary home&#x20;
  * For reference, options from Ella on maximum ADU footprint:
    * No change: 900 square feet or 30% of gross floor area of primary home&#x20;
    * Potential changes:
      * Increase in maximum square feet&#x20;
      * Increase in maximum percentage of primary home&#x20;
* ADU Minimum Dimensions (How narrow can the rectangle be?)
* ADU Maximum Height (Does this matter?)
