# Accessory-Existing

Data Services needs to identify which of the options below we want to use. This is identified as a next step under Project Management.

### Possible Options for Analysis

* ~~Option 1: Evaluate using the `NUM_BUILD` field (Ruled out based on data quality)~~
* Option 2: Evaluate using the `BUILDING_TYPE`, `BUILD_TYPE2`, and `BUILD_TYPE3` (All from CAMA)
* Option 3: Add structures layer from MassGIS, establish centroids, calculate SF, and sum by parcel
