* [ ] Please confirm that the setbacks recorded in the Minimum Yards - Front, Minimum Yards - Side, and Minimum Yards - Rear [columns in the Airtable](../../../policy/assumptions-and-policy/citywide-dimensional-requirements.md) are correct. Will these setbacks be fixed or flexible parameters? For reference, policy options from Ella on minimum setbacks:
  * No change: Same as underlying lot size&#x20;
  * Potential changes:&#x20;
    * Rear, side, and/or front setbacks are decreased to x, x, and x feet&#x20;
    * No additional setback for ADUs within or attached to non-conforming existing structures&#x20;
* [ ] _The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units_ (Dain, 2018) suggests ADU Ordinances and Bylaws commonly control ADUs by **percent of primary unit floor area** and/or **percent expansion of primary dwelling.** Do you imagine wanting to regulate ADUs using either or both of these parameters?

#### For Data Services

* [ ] Data Services needs to identify how we want to approach our analysis. Apart from the ADU buffers, is this different than the process for "Accessory-New"?
