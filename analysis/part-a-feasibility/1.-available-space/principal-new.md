* [ ] _The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units_ (Dain, 2018) suggests ADU Ordinances and Bylaws commonly control ADUs by **percent of primary unit floor area** and/or **percent expansion of primary dwelling.** Do you imagine wanting to regulate ADUs using either or both of these parameters?

#### For Data Services

* [ ] Data Services needs to identify how we want to approach our analysis. Apart from the ADU buffers, is this different than the process for "Accessory-New"?
