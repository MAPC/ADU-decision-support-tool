# Principal-New

<mark style="background-color:orange;">The State of Zoning for Accessory Dwelling Units suggests ADU Ordinances and Bylaws commonly control ADUs by percent of primary unit floor area and/or percent expansion of primary dwelling. We might want to account for these in our analysis.</mark>

Apart from the ADU buffers, is this different than the process for "Accessory-New"?
