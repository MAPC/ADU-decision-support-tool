# Part A. Output

#### Ideas for Combination

* Script that places it at 100 spots in the buildable area, tries and tries, and then puts in a spot that fits and/or create a fishnet and see if it works
* Maybe this is too elaborate, but if your buildable area is an acre -- what are the minimum dimensions across the buildable area.
* Two types of constrained area: Constraints that yield unbuildable area (steep slopes, setbacks) and constraints that yield a parcel maximum.
