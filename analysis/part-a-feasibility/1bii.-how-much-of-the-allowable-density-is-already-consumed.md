# 1Bii. How much of the allowable density is already consumed?

### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Outstanding Questions (Copied to</mark> [<mark style="background-color:orange;">Proposed Next Steps</mark>](../../project-management/proposed-next-steps.md)<mark style="background-color:orange;">)</mark>

* [ ] We assume ADUs will count towards at least a few parcel-wide density controls. For example, if an ADU would push the parcel beyond a maximum FAR, the ADU could not be built. Is this assumption correct? If so, what of the existing (or non-existing) dimensional regulations should we take into account? A partial list is below.
* [ ] Is it safe to assume we can ignore the potential for subdivision of lots greater than twice the lot area minimum?

### Factors We Could Explore

#### Regulated by Beverly's Zoning Ordinance (Likely not comprehensive; Land Use should review)

* Maximum lot coverage
  * Maximum lot coverage (Structures)
  * Maximum lot coverage (Impervious Surface Area)
  * For reference, options from Ella on maximum lot coverage:
    * No change: None&#x20;
    * Potential changes:&#x20;
      * X% for lots greater than Y square feet and Z% for lots less than Y square feet&#x20;
* Maximum Height

#### Other Ideas (I don't know how I came up with this list so I'm preserving it. It seems weird though.)

* Consumed FAR
* Consumed open space
* Consumed bedrooms
* Maximum Density
  * For reference, options from Ella on density:
    * No change: Based on lot size, frontage, and setbacks&#x20;
    * Potential change:&#x20;
      * Maximum of d/u per acre&#x20;
