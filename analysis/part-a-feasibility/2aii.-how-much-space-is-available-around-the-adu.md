# 2Aii. How much space is available around the ADU?

From Ella's ADU Policy Options: What types of ADUs are allowed? If detached is allowed, what is the minimum buffer between ADU and primary?&#x20;

* No change:  N/A
* Potential changes:&#x20;
  * Same as underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
  * Half of underlying zoning side setback&#x20;
  * 10 feet&#x20;

What are the design requirements for ADUs?&#x20;

* No change: Entrance must be enclosed and into side or rear&#x20;
* Potential change: Same design requirement as primary dwelling&#x20;

### Factors We Could Explore

* ADU Front Setback, Side Setbacks, and Rear Setback
* Separation between ADU and Principal Building
* Separation between ADU and other Accessory Buildings
* Orientation of entrance, one other statement about entrances I don't understand
