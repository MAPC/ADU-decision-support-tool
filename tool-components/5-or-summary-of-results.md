# 5 | Summary of Results

The fifth model, 5 | Summary of Results, joins the outputs from the four ADU Fit Tests back to the All Parcels input, to generate a complete table of results. The model then optionally summarizes these results by user-specified summary geography, such as neighborhood boundaries. This offers one way to understand the possible results of ADU development under current and proposed ADU policies.
