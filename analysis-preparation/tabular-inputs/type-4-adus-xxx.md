# For Type 4 ADUs

The fifth tab of the Excel Spreadsheet, **aduty4\_inputs**, is specific to Type 4 (or Accessory-New) ADUs: ADUs developed as a new, accessory structure, one that is detached from all other structures on the parcel.&#x20;

If Type 4 ADUs are not allowed within any zoning district, this tab can be ignored. If Type 4 ADUs are allowable, a user should complete all rows and all fields in the sheet, using the prompts provided. Please note that even though Column J prompts the user for Required On-site Parking Spaces, the tool is not capable of evaluating on-site parking.
