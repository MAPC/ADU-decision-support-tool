# For Type 3 ADUs

The fourth tab of the Excel Spreadsheet, **aduty3\_inputs**, is specific to Type 3 (or Accessory-Existing) ADUs: ADUs developed within an existing accessory structure, without any expansion of that building's foundation. If Type 3 ADUs are not allowable within any zoning district, this tab can be ignored. If Type 3 ADUs are allowable, a user should complete all rows and all fields in the sheet, using the prompts provided. Note that even though Column F prompts the user for Required On-site Parking Spaces, the tool is not capable of evaluating on-site parking at this time.
