# Tabular Inputs

The ADU Analytical Tool requires both tabular and spatial inputs, which collectively define an ADU policy. In general, the Tabular Inputs define binary and numerical policy elements, such as whether a particular ADU Typology is allowable and the minimum size of a principal building. Tabular Inputs are evaluated using information that is already present in municipal parcel and zoning data. Spatial Inputs, in contrast, define spatial relationships, such as policy boundaries and spatial features that could yield a parcel ineligible for an ADU.

Tabular Inputs are organized into a single Excel spreadsheet, \[NAME OF EXCEL SPREADSHEET], present in the downloaded folder. The spreadsheet has five tabs, one tab with inputs that are required regardless of the ADU policy, and four tabs corresponding to each ADU typology. If the policy does not allow a particular ADU typology at all, that tab does not need to be completed.
