# Tabular Inputs

The ADU Tool requires tabular and spatial inputs, which together define the ADU policy the tool will evaluate. In general, the tabular inputs define boolean and numerical elements of the policy, such as whether a particular ADU typology is allowable and the minimum size for the principal building on a parcel. The spatial inputs, in contrast, define location elements of the policy, such as the ADU Boundary and spatial features which, if present on a parcel, would yield it ineligible for an ADU. A user may vary tabular inputs by zoning district and by ADU typology; the tool applies one set of spatial inputs to all zoning districts and all ADU typologies at this time.

#### Tabular Inputs

Tabular inputs are organized into a single Excel spreadsheet, **zoningedits\_FINALTEMPLATE.xlsx**, present in the downloaded folder. The spreadsheet has five tabs, one tab with inputs that are required regardless of the ADU policy, and four tabs corresponding to each of the ADU typologies. If the ADU policy does not allow a particular ADU typology, that tab does not need to be completed.
