# For Type 2 ADUs

The third tab of the Excel Spreadsheet, **aduty2\_inputs**, is specific to Type 2 (or Principal-New) ADUs: ADUs developed as an addition to the principal building, through an expansion of that building's foundation.

If Type 2 ADUs are not allowed within any zoning district, this tab can be ignored. If Type 2 ADUs are allowable, a user should complete all rows and all fields in the sheet, using the prompts provided. Please note that even though Column L prompts the user for Required On-site Parking Spaces, the tool is not capable of evaluating on-site parking at this time.
