# For Type 1 ADUs

The second tab of the Excel Spreadsheet, **aduty1\_inputs**, is specific to Type 1 (or Principal-Existing) ADUs: ADUs developed within the principal building, without any expansion of that building's foundation. If Type 1 ADUs are not allowable within any zoning district, this tab can be ignored. If Type 1 ADUs are allowable, a user should complete all rows and all fields in the sheet, using the prompts provided. Note that even though Column H prompts the user for Required On-site Parking Spaces, the tool is not capable of evaluating on-site parking.
