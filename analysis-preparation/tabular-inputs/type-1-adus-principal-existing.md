# For Type 1 ADUs

The second tab of the Excel Spreadsheet, **aduty1\_inputs**, is specific to Type 1 (or Principal-Existing) ADUs, that is, ADUs developed within the principal building, without any expansion of that building's foundation. If Type 1 ADUs are not allowable within any zoning district, this tab can be ignored. If this is not the case, a user should complete all rows and all fields, using the prompts provided. Note that even though the spreadsheet prompts the user for Required On-site Parking Spaces, the tool does not currently process these inputs.
