# 3-2. All Structures

{% hint style="info" %}
Type 2 and Type 4 ADUs each involve the construction of an ADU outside of the existing structures on the parcel. To ensure the tool does not place a Type 2 or Type 4 ADU where a structure is already present, and erroneously conclude it would fit on the parcel, the location of existing structures is required. The location of existing structures is also needed for the placement of on-site parking spaces.

1. If it has not already been retrieved in an earlier step, retrieve spatial data for the building roofprints in the Study Municipality. We recommend sourcing this data from the MassGIS Building Structures layer, available for download at [https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-building-structures-2-d#downloads-](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-building-structures-2-d#downloads-) Add the downloaded spatial data to ADUTool.gdb, titled "all\_structures."
