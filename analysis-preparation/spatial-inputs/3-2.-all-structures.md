# For Type 2 and 4 ADUs

Type 2 (Principal-New) and Type 4 (Accessory-New) ADUs each involve the construction of an ADU beyond the footprints of the existing structures on the parcel. To ensure the tool does not place a Type 2 or Type 4 ADU where a structure is already present, and erroneously conclude an ADU would fit on the parcel, the location of existing structures is required. The **All Structures** input defines these locations.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the structures in the Study Municipality. The ADU Tool was developed using structure data from the MassGIS Building Structures layer, and we highly recommend continuing to use this data as the source for the All Structures Input. Data is available here: [https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-building-structures-2-d#downloads-](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-building-structures-2-d#downloads-)&#x20;
* [ ] Add the downloaded spatial data to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "allstructures."

{% hint style="info" %}
A blank "allstructures" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file. An example "allstructures" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Reference.gdb file, titled "ex\_allstructures."
