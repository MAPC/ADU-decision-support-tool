* Building roofprint spatial data
* o Web resource listed in spatial data browser: [http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/structures.html](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/structures.html)
* o K drive local copy listed in spatial data browser: K:\DataServices\Datasets\MassGIS\Facilities\_Structures
* o Because only building roofprint geometry is needed, there is no reason not to use any comparable alternative. Currently, the script supports ESRI shapefile format.&#x20;
