# 2. Parcel-level Exclusions

**Parcel-level Exclusions** collectively describe characteristics of parcels that yield a parcel ineligible for an ADU, regardless of whether that parcel is located within the Effective ADU Boundary (Step 4c). In contrast with ADU Exclusions, Parcel-level Exclusions are not a function of where a given parcel is located; in theory, the parcel could be moved to a different area within the Study Municipality and would remain ineligible due to the characteristics inherent to that parcel and its associated structures.

As with the ADU Boundary and ADU Exclusions layers, Parcel-level Exclusions will be determined by the policy under consideration. Parcel-level exclusions may involve spatial features present on the parcel, such as the exclusion of all parcels with a historical building point, but could also involve text or numerical attributes, such as the exclusion of all parcels with non-residential land use.

The pages referenced below provide instructions for the preparation of the four excluding layers. If a&#x20;
