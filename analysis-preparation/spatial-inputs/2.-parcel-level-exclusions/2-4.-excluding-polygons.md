# 2-4. Excluding Polygons

The **Excluding Polygons** input will define polygon geometry, that, if present on a parcel, would render that parcel ineligible for an ADU. As with the ADU Boundary input, the Excluding Polygons input will be determined by the policy under consideration.&#x20;

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Review the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance and identify the data layer(s) required to define all excluding polygon geometry. Retrieve and/or create the data layer(s).
* [ ] If applicable, eliminate any features in the data layer(s) that should not result in a parcel exclusion.
* [ ] If working with multiple data layers, merge them into a **single layer.** Produce a single feature class, where all lines represent features that, if present on a parcel, would yield the parcel ineligible for an ADU. **The layer must contain a field "excl\_poly" (Data Type: Short, Suggested Alias: Excluding Polygons) populated with a value of "1".**

{% hint style="info" %}
Blank and example "excl\_polygons" layers are available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file, titled, "excl\_polygons" and "ex\_excl\_polygons," respectively.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Export the resulting file to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "excl\_polygons."
