# 2-3. Excluding Polygons

The **Excluding Polygons** input defines polygon geometry, that, if present on a parcel, renders that parcel ineligible for an ADU. As with the other spatial inputs, the Excluding Polygons input will be determined by the policy under consideration.&#x20;

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Review the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance and identify the data layer(s) required to define all excluding polygon geometry. Retrieve and/or create the data layer(s).
* [ ] If applicable, eliminate any features in the data layer(s) that should not result in a parcel exclusion.
* [ ] If working with multiple data layers, merge them into a **single layer.** Produce a single feature class, where all lines represent features that, if present on a parcel, would yield the parcel ineligible for an ADU. **The layer must contain a field "excl\_poly" (Data Type: Short, Suggested Alias: Excluding Polygons) populated with a value of 1.**
* [ ] Export the resulting file to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "excl\_polygons."

{% hint style="info" %}
A blank "excl\_polygons" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file. An example "excl\_polygons" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Reference.gdb file, titled "ex\_excl\_polygons."
