# 2-2. Excluding Points

Point geometry, the presence of which renders the parcel ineligible for an ADU.&#x20;

1. Review the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance and identify the data layer(s) required to define all excluding point geometry. Retrieve and/or create the data layer(s).
2. If applicable, eliminate any features in the data layer(s) that should not result in a parcel exclusion.
3. If working with multiple data layers, merge them into a single layer. Produce a single feature class, where all points represent features that, if present on a parcel, would yield the parcel ineligible for an ADU.
4. Export the resulting file to ADUTool.gdb, titled "ExcludingPoints."
