# 3. All Parcels

The **All Parcels** input comprises all parcels in the Study Municipality.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the parcels in the municipality with the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance, the "Study Municipality." We highly recommend sourcing parcel data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database, available for download at [https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb](https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb)
* [ ] Discard any parcels not located within the Study Municipality, using the Municipal ID (muni\_id) field.&#x20;
* [ ] Export the resulting file to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "allparcels."

{% hint style="info" %}
Blank and example "allparlces" layers are available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file, titled, "allparcels" and "ex\_allparcels" respectively.
{% endhint %}

Note:&#x20;

If you do not wish to proceed with the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database, the following fields must be present in the parcel data used in the automated analysis:

* MassGIS Parcel ID (parloc\_id)
* Gross Building Area (bldg\_area)
* Finished Building Area (res\_area)
