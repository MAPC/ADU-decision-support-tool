# 1-1. ADU Boundary

The **ADU Boundary** input delineates the area _outside of which_ an ADU may not be located, regardless of whether one would otherwise be permitted.&#x20;

The ADU Boundary input is determined by the policy under consideration. It may consist of one or more areas within the municipality, such as the area defined by a zoning district, areas within 1/2-mile of transit stations, or a combination of factors. If the policy does not reference a specific boundary, the ADU Boundary layer should be defined using the boundary of the municipality with the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance, the "Study Municipality."

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Review the draft ADU Bylaw or Ordinance and identify the data layer(s) required to define the ADU Boundary. Retrieve and/or create the data layer(s).&#x20;
* [ ] If working with multiple data layers, merge them into a single layer. Then produce **a single-part polygon**, where the enclosed area represents geography where ADUs _may be_ permitted. **The layer must contain a field "adu\_bound" (Data Type: Short, Suggested Alias: ADU Boundary) populated with a value of "1".**

{% hint style="info" %}
Blank and example "aduboundary" layers are available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file, titled, "aduboundary" and "ex\_aduboundary," respectively.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Export the resulting ADU Boundary file to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "aduboundary".
