# 1-3. All Parcels

The **All Parcels** input is the geography for all parcels within the Study Municipality and their corresponding attributes.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the parcels in the Study Municipality. The ADU Tool was developed using parcel data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database and we highly recommend continuing to use this data as the source for the All Parcels Input. Data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database is available at [https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb](https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not wish to proceed with parcel data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database, be sure to include the following fields in the all parcels layer:

* muni\_id
  * Data Type: Short
  * Suggested Alias: Municipal ID
* parloc\_id&#x20;
  * Data Type: Text
  * Suggested Alias: MassGIS Parcel ID
* poly\_type
  * Data Type: Text
  * Suggested Alias: Type of Parcel
* bldg\_area
  * Data Type: Double
  * Suggested Alias: Gross Building Area&#x20;
* res\_area
  * Data Type: Double
  * Suggested Alias: Finished Building Area&#x20;

The ADU Tool requires these inputs.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Discard any parcels not located within the Study Municipality, using the Municipal ID (muni\_id) field.&#x20;
* [ ] Export the resulting file to ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "allparcels."

{% hint style="info" %}
A blank "allparcels" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file. An example "allparcels" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Reference.gdb file, titled "ex\_allparcels."
