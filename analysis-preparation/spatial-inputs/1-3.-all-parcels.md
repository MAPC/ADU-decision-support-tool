# 1-3. All Parcels

The **All Parcels** input is the geography for all parcels within the Study Municipality, and their corresponding attributes.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the parcels in the Study Municipality. The ADU Tool was developed using parcel data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database and we highly recommend continuing to use this data as the source for the All Parcels Input. Data from the Massachusetts Land Parcel Database is available at [https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb](https://www.mapc.org/learn/data/#landparceldb).
