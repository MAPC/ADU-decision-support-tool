# 3-1. Zoning&#x20;

The **Zoning** input is the geography for all zoning districts within the Study Municipality. This input corresponds with the tabular inputs Excel spreadsheet. The Zone Code attribute in the Zoning input must be identical in structure to the Zone Code field in the [Required Fields](../tabular-inputs/all-adus.md) sheet, as these two fields will be used to join the tabular and spatial data in the automated analysis.

#### Input Preparation

* [ ] Retrieve spatial data for the zoning districts in the Study Municipality.&#x20;
* [ ] Review the zoning data attribute table for the Zone Code field, creating it if it does not exist:
  * Zone Code (zo\_code): Concatenation of muni\_id and zo\_abbr. Formula: muni\_id\&zo\_abbr
    * Municipal ID (muni\_id): Municipality ID, as assigned by MassGIS.
    * Zone Abbreviation (zo\_abbr): Zoning district abbreviation, as it appears in the municipality's zoning by-law.
* [ ] Export the resulting file to  ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb, titled "zoning\_base."

A blank "zoning\_base" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Spatial-Inputs.gdb file. An example "zoning base" layer is available within the ADU-Analytical-Tool\_Reference.gdb file, titled "ex\_zoning\_base."
